You will need to download the Apache Newt tool, as documented in the [Getting Started Guide](http://mynewt.apache.org/os/get_started/introduction/).

2. Download the Apache Mynewt Core package (executed from the blinky directory).

```no-highlight
    $ newt install
```

3. Build the ... app for the sim platform using the "..._sim" target
(executed from the ... directory).
